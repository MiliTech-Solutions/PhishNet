Report vulnerabilities privately via security@placeholder.local (update later). Do NOT open public issues for sensitive disclosures.

Secret leakage: rotate immediately and revoke exposed credentials. GitHub secret scanning planned.

## Vulnerability Severity & SLA (Initial Targets)
| Severity | Triage | Fix/Mitigate |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Critical | <24h   | <72h         |
| High     | <48h   | <7d          |
| Medium   | <5d    | <30d         |
| Low      | Batch  | Routine      |

Clock starts when a reproducible report is confirmed.

Canonical; other security docs live under `docs/security/` and should not duplicate this summary.
