# Contributing (Bootstrap Draft)

Trunk-based: only `main` is long-lived.
Branch naming: `type/PHN-###-short-slug` (types: feature, fix, chore, docs, test, refactor, ci, build).
Include Jira key in PR title & first description line.
Squash merges only. CI must be green.

More detail will be added in Part 10.
