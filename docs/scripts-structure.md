# Scripts Structure (Planned)

Categories:
- bootstrap: environment verification & initial setup
- dev: run concurrent dev processes
- check: aggregate lint + typecheck + tests
- doctor: diagnostics (versions, docker status)
- validate-branch-name: warns if branch naming off-spec

All to be implemented later in `scripts/` as TypeScript or Node ESM.
